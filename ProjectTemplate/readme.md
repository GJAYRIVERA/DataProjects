# Project Template

This folder serves as a reusable template for data science projects. Use it to maintain consistency and structure across all projects.

## Folder Structure

- **`data/`**: Store raw and processed datasets here.
- **`notebooks/`**: Keep Jupyter notebooks for analysis and exploration here.
- **`scripts/`**: Add Python scripts for data processing, cleaning, or modeling.
- **`results/`**: Save visualizations, reports, and outputs here.
- **`README.md`**: Write a description of the project, including objectives, datasets, and steps.

## How to Use
1. **Duplicate the Template**: Copy the `ProjectTemplate` folder and rename it (e.g., `Project1`).
2. **Customize the README**: Update the `README.md` with project-specific details.
3. **Organize Your Work**: Place datasets in `data/`, code in `scripts/` or `notebooks/`, and outputs in `results/`.
